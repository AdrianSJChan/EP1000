	<h1><b>Saftey Programme and Quiz</b></h1>
	<p>In order to operate the exciting machines in the digital fabrications labs every student needs to go through a safety program and are required to pass a safety quiz. Here in this page I will be going through what I have learnt in the safety programme and my safety quiz results!</p>

	<p>On the first week of lessons in FabLab every student is required to go through a safety course in order to mitigate or reduce the hazards that every student may face in the workshops. In this programme we learn what attire should be worn, how your workshop should be kept, what to do in an event of different emergency senarios and lastly the relavant hotlines that should be contacted during emergencies.</p>
